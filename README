Merge Package Manager Emulator
==============================

* What is package manager emulation?
  With merge, you can simulate any package manager on your system.

  Even the underlying software doesn't support what you're doing.

* Examples
  Let's assume you're running windows (sadly) and want to use the pacman package manager.
  With merge, you'll be able to use `pacman -S package` instead of something like `scoop install`

  This has a lot of benefits when you consider FOSS is liberal and many of the developing community
  has different decisions as their operating system, package manager etc.

  So depending on a document that doesn't support what you have as your software (e.g package manager)
  would require at least a internet search.

  Also a lot of people work with advanced cloud integrations, remote machines, servers etc.

  And because for the sake of standardization of your software, people use technologies like
  docker, CI/CD/CT services, Virtual Machines etc.

  This can cause a lot of fuzz on your head because all the software you use are doing similar things
  but the commands are different.

  e.g:

    (permissions are omitted)
      pacman -S vim
      apt install vim
      apt-get install vim
      nix shell vim        # this makes it a bit differently but who cares (you can opt `nix profile install` or even `nix-env`)
      emerge -i vim
      apk add vim
      yum install vim
      scoop install vim
      choco install vim
      brew install vim
      port install vim

    All the above scripts does the exact same thing: installing the only text editor in the universe.
    but see how it differs on the package manager you're using. That is not possible to solve because
    no one will stop using the package manager they use to make another package manager just to get
    "more dominant". But we can at least "try".

    Here is the solution I've (tried to) come up with:

      merge knows everything about a wide range of package managers (including your favorite)
      and understands every possible representation[1] given to it.

      It gives the options for all the package manager managers for you to choose.

  Project `merge` aims to help these people by standardizing the process of software management (especially package managers)
